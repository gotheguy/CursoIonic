            <p>Hello World,</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Ionic 3 Apps for WooCommerce:Build an eCommerce Mobile App</strong> course. In the first few lectures, we will be learning to things with Ionic and try building and running apps. Once youare comfortable with the commands, we will build WooIonic and start working our way up to building a complete Mobile App.</p>

<p>For each lecture in which we work in the Ionic App,<strong>WooIonic</strong>, we have its finished code available on the Course's official GitHub repository.<br></p>

<p>Each lecture in the course has its own branch in the GitHub Repository. The name of the branch is mentioned in each lecture on the welcome screen. You can use the Branch to get the code for that lecture of you are stuck or just need a reference.</p>

<p>The finished app code will be available in the master branch once the app is complete with PayPal andPush Notifications. If you have implemented a cool feature, make a pull request and we will have a better app every single time.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy the course and build something cool yourself.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>Samarth Agarwal</p>
